## Basic Usage

Getting started and using the Frost Builder is really simple.
Once you install the package, simply create a frost.config.js file
in your projects root directory.

In this file, you can modify (any of the options you see here)[https://github.com/Bashkir15/frost/packages/frost-builder/src/defaults.js]
until you are building how you like.
